# Project Title
Social-Network-API

Week-18 Challenge (MongoDB)

## Description

This application marks the initiation of a comprehensive full-stack social network project utilizing a MongoDB database, Express.js routing, and the Mongoose ODM. It establishes the foundational CRUD API routes, enabling users to be created, searched, updated, and deleted. Users have the ability to share thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, maintain a friend list, and subsequently delete thoughts, reactions, friends, and their own user profiles. While the application is in its early stages, the integration of MongoDB and the API middleware routing represents a crucial initial step in exploring the capabilities of MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM.

Throughout the development process, I faced notable challenges. Despite MongoDB's flexibility compared to SQL in terms of querying and data addition, identifying errors proved more challenging and troubleshooting became more intricate. Additionally, optimizing the deletion of data on cascade and managing join tables posed difficulties. Although MongoDB typically requires less code than SQL, adapting to its nuances presented a learning curve, as there is considerable underlying complexity that I am still working to fully comprehend.

Despite these challenges, this project has equipped me with another potent tool in the MERN stack, enhancing my proficiency in full-stack development. Moving forward, I aim to further develop the application by incorporating a comprehensive front-end UI with React, thus transforming it into a fully-fledged MERN stack application.
